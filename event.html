In the mid-1990s, its developer—Intel engineer Jim Kardach—was trying to think up a name for the new technology. Reading about Viking history at the time, he was intrigued by a stone inscribed with runes that praised the exploits of a 10th-century Danish king called Harald Bluetooth.

                        The stone described how Bluetooth had brought the Danes together as one people and conquered Norway. “It occurred to me that [his name] would make a good code name for the program,” Kardach wrote. Other names were considered, but the Viking ruler’s moniker stuck. Bluetooth technology set out to conquer and connect the modern world, just as King Bluetooth had connected and conquered swathes of Scandinavia more than a thousand years before.</p>
